# Swiggy-aSDE---Round-1-coding-test

1. First of all Created the Player class to define their attributes like health, strength and attack.
2. Created attack method in Player class to find the Attacking power using the logic given in the problem.
3. Now the attack method will call the defend method to find out the defending power and on subtracting both values we get the actual damage.
4. One more method isAlive need to be coded to find out whether the player is alive or dead already.
5. Apart from that getters for all the Attributes are declared.

6. Next I created another class which is the Game class, where I declared the method fight to perform the actual fight and decide which player will attack first and the further sequence of attacking.

7. Main methods declare the player with their attributes and calles the Game class's fight method to get the actual answer.
